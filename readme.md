# Hello!

I'm a current Master's Student in Computer Science at the University of Chicago. 

I am seeking an internship for Summer 2024. 

My experience includes:

- Writing parallel implementations in C/C++ of scientific computing algorithms for use on shared/distributed memory systems with OpenMP/MPI
- Optimizing performance of serial algorithms/serial components of parallel algorithms using SIMD
- Programming for GPUs with CUDA
- Implementing parallel sorting algorithms in Go
- Developing a Python FaaS platform using FastAPI, ZMQ, and Redis
- Writing a compiler in Go for a subset of the Go programming language using ANTLR and LLVM
- Administering a personal Linux server using Docker and QEMU/KVM
- Working with embedded Linux devices for personal projects, including using Buildroot to configure and compile OpenWRT

I enjoy writing code with a focus on performance and correctness, and reasoning about how to implement serial and parallel algorithms in a way that is appropriate for the architecture on which they will run. 

Since September 2023, I have served as a Teaching Assistant for MPCS 55001 "Algorithms". I develop content for and lead office hour sessions, answer student questions, and write homework and exam problems. I also supervise the grading of assignments. 

I have previously worked as a Research Specialist at the University of Chicago Law School, where I assisted with quantitative research on policing and private security. I primarily wrote code in R to clean data and conduct statistical analyses. I am a coauthor on "Private Policing and Public Police", which has recently been accepted for publication at the Journal of Empirical Legal Studies.
